                                <p>Netbeans IDE is a programming tool. Netbeans is made by the Oracle Corporation for creating programs, compiling, debugging and implementing them. IDE means Integrated development environment; it is software that helps a developer with developing of software. In the beginning there were only a compiler and a debugger and the source code was most of the time changed with simple editors. To simplify the different little programs, they integrated it with each other to make a development environment, so it works faster because now you do not have to switch between different programs. Most IDE use different components, for example: a debugger, an editor with a graphic interface.</p>
                                <p>They use the program at the IT department of the company 2beIT. They use the program for the development of webpages.</p><br>


                                <p><u>Positive features :</u></p>
                            <p>What I found good is that Netbeans includes support for JavaScript and HTML.
                                For JavaScript there is improved support for Node.js.</p>
                            <p>Another good feature is that plugins could be easily added, if and when needed. There is also a tab for plugins in the menu bar.</p>
<p>When you have any questions : NetBeans also provides a good online support on the internet.
    Editors, source code analysers, and converters can help you to detect typing mistakes or syntax errors.
    It also offers an extensive set of hints.  When there is an error, it will give you most likely a hint how to fix it.</p>
<p>The next good thing is that there are also extensive functionality and different options that you can use while developing.</p>
<p>In Netbeans, there is also a full range of refactoring tools available, with different options.</p>
 
<p>You can also find some Inspect & Transform tools that enables developers to run inspections across the codebase, while automatically fixing your code. It also shows you how you can refactor your codebase.</p>
<p>Netbeans includes, now, a sexy (and useful) graph view with examples what it would look like, in real time.
    And last but not least, the NetBeans profiler is very nice for understanding both CPU and memory use, and it also has good tools for finding memory leaks.</p><br> 
<p><u>Negative features :</u></p>
                            <p>I find it unfortunate that Neatbeans doesnâ€™t support PHP while other bundles do support PHP.</p>
                            <p>Apparently, there are fewer plugins for Netbeans than for other similar programs.</p>


                            <p>I like to use Netbeans because you can use it for almost every programming language. To be honest there are many other tools that can do the same thing like making a project and writing code, for example Sublime Text 3. I would recommend Netbeans to coders who make web applications because you can use it for almost every language and it has code completion and code debugging.</p><br>

                            <p><b>NetBeans</b></p>
                            <p>The NetBeans Java IDE started life as a university student project in Prague in 1996, became a commercial product in 1997, was bought by Sun in 1999, and was released to open source in 2000.<p>
                            <p>The current version, 8.1, runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris, and a portable subset runs on other systems that support Java. I downloaded the Java EE bundle, one of 6 stock options. This bundle includes JavaScript and HTML support, GlassFish, and Tomcat, but not the support for PHP, C/C++/Fortran, Groovy, and Grails included in the "All" download bundle. I could easily add those plugins and many others if and when needed: NetBeans has fewer plugins than Eclipse, but they are less likely to interfere with each other.</p>
                            <p>Oracle, which still manages and contributes to the NetBeans open source project, considers NetBeans the official IDE for Java 8. While that distinction mattered for about a month after Java 8 was released in 2014, when the other IDEs were being updated to support new Java 8 features, I'm not convinced it matters today.<p>
                            <p>NetBeans does have good support for Java 8, and for conversion of older code to use Java 8. Its editors, code analyzers, and converters can help you to upgrade your applications to use new Java 8 language constructs, such as lambdas, functional operations, and method references. JavaScript plugins in NetBeans 8 include improved support for Node.js and support for newer JavaScript tools such as Gulp and Mocha, as well as support for Nashorn, the JavaScript interpreter.</p><br>
 
                            <p>Figure 3. This is NetBeans working with the same Maven-based project that IntelliJ IDEA had open in Figure 1. Notice the extensive functionality in the context menu and its refactor submenu.</p><br>
<p><b>Editing and refactoring</b></p>
<p>The language-aware NetBeans editor detects errors while you type and assists you with documentation popups and smart code completion. It seems to do so with less in the way of noticeable pauses than Eclipse does, although slightly more than IntelliJ IDEA. NetBeans also offers a full range of refactoring tools (shown in Figure 3) to allow you to restructure code without breaking it; performs source code analysis; and offers an extensive set of hints to quickly fix or enhance your code. NetBeans includes a design tool for Swing GUIs, previously known as "Project Matisse."</p>
<p>The Inspect & Transform tool enables you to run inspections across your codebase, while automatically fixing your code. Personally, I always make sure I've checked in all my code and run all my unit tests successfully before running tools that can make sweeping changes; I've been burnt more than once by automatic "fixes" that cause regressions.</p><br>
<p><b>Building, debugging, and profiling</b></p>
<p>NetBeans has good built-in support for Maven and Ant, and a plugin for Gradle. I was pleased to discover that existing Maven projects are now treated as "native," meaning that you simply open them rather than importing them. NetBeans also includes a sexy (and useful) graph view for Maven dependencies.</p>
<p>The NetBeans Java debugger is good, albeit conventional. A separate visual debugger lets you take GUI snapshots and visually explore the GUI of JavaFX and Swing applications. The NetBeans profiler is very nice for understanding both CPU and memory use, and has good tools for finding memory leaks.</p><br>
