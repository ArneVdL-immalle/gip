                                My name is Arne Van den Langenbergh. I’m 17 years old.<br>
                                My hobbies are swimming and of course also being on my laptop. <br>
                                I go to the Immaculata Institute in Oost-Malle. I have been at this school since the fifth year, before I was in the Sint Jozef Institute in Schoten. I studied Electronics ICT. I thought I would learn to be a programmer but that wasn't the case, I learned there how you must make electronic circuits with a programming language that was named “C”. I didn't want to learn that subject so I changed from school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I was 7 years old, I started playing computer games.<br>
                                I played “Robby the rabbit”, a game about language, mathematics and entertainment. I liked the game when I was young.<br> 
                                When I was a little bit older I was searching on the Ketnet website for tv content and games.<br>
                                I liked to watch videos with my brother. When I was in my last year in elementary school I looked at YouTube videos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               IT means all of my life to me.<br> 
                                I spend at least 6 hours on my laptop per day. In the weekend it’s even more.<br> 
                                I build and play Minecraft and moderate a server on Minecraft. Minecraft is a game where you can build buildings and “redstone contraptions” and try to survive in an online world. <br>
                                I have already made several websites for myself and helped someone with their websites and redesigned the website theburgershop.<br>
                                I learned to make websites on my own. I now know several programming languages already.<br> 
                                I like to work on my computer because I can communicate with many people and I can communicate easier with other people than in real life. I communicate via Teamspeak, this is a program where you can talk and chat with other people. And in our Minecraft team we use Slack to communicate, we chat about our building projects and with the other moderators we discuss about the other players if they did something wrong.<br>
                                When I started at Immaculata I already knew a lot about HTML and CSS. But I also learned new things for example C#(spoken as "C sharp") and I have learned more about javascript, how it works, and a little bit Lua when we played Minecraft in class.<br> 
                                I don't see myself as an expert because I can still learn more about it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My plans for later are that I want to keep on swimming.<br> 
                                I want to create websites, I want to be a programmer. <br>
                                When I'm finished at Immaculata, I want to study web design in a professional bachelor or at HBO 5.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My life is much connected with my laptop because I have a lot of online friends.<br> 
                                My laptop is a great part of my social life, in that way IT is very important for me.
                            </p>
